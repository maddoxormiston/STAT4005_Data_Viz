## Section 9: What is Shiny?

### Exercise 1

The user is allowed to change n, the intercept, slope, and standard deviation of residuals.

### Exercise 2

The outputs on the first tab are a graph and table, and the second tab has three graphs and one table.

### Exercise 3

I chose the nutrition calculator. The user is able to add an ingredient using a drop-down list, choose a measure unit depending on the ingredient, the quantity, and number of servings contained. The output is two tables and three bar graphs: one table of the ingredients added, one of the nutrition facts, one graph each of macronutrients, minerals, and vitamins v their % daily value. I found it interesting how much nutrients the fruits I chose have!
