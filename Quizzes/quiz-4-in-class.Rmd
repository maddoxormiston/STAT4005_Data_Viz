```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(leaflet)
library(readr)
alcohol_df <- read_csv(here("data/alcohol.csv"))
country_df <- ggplot2::map_data("world")
```

## Question 1

```{r}
world_full <- left_join(country_df, alcohol_df, by = c("region" = "country"))

ggplot(data = world_full, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  geom_polygon(colour = "black", aes(fill = beer_servings)) + 
  coord_map(projection = "globular", xlim=c(-180,180)) +
  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_viridis_b()
```

## Question 2

We could use a lollipop ghraph to show the top 10 beer consumers in the world.
